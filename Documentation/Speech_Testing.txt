Speech Testing Protocol

0) Download a suitable voice for the language you'd like to test in the Speech System Preferences pane, and set it as your default voice. At the moment, voices are not yet downloadable through the standard system updates server, so you need to temporarily point to a different server:

To set your Software Update server to find the premium voices, execute these commands:

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL 'http://speech8.apple.com/TestUpdate/index.sucatalog'
sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate EnableSpecialTestMode -bool YES

To reset your Software Update server to the standard server, execute these commands:

sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL
sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate EnableSpecialTestMode
